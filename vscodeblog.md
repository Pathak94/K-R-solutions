## Debugging Nordic's nRF5x on Visual Studio Code

Here at Electronut Labs we work extensively on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. And, we have chosen Nordic semicondctor's nRF5x series boards for developing our products. We have our own range of breakout boards based on nRF5x series microcontrolers . You can visit out [website](https://electronut.in/portfolio/) or [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/ElectronutLabs/) to purchase our boards. 

We really like Visual Studio Code editor for development. There UI is awesome and they provide some cool extension which will make your coding process fun and easy. I am going to talk about one such amazing extension for debugging and several other extensions will help you immensely in your development process.

Debuging on Visual Studio Code is very fast and efficient. I am going to show you how to setup and start enjoying coding. This setup is going to work with any nRF5x boards. And later I'm going to show you how to debug on our nRF5x breakout board [hackaBLE](https://electronut.in/portfolio/hackaBLE/) and programming using [Bumpy](https://electronut.in/portfolio/bumpy/), our SWD programmer.
